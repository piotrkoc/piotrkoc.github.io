I am a political scientist and sociologist, currently a PhD candidate at the Institute of Philosophy and Sociology, Polish Academy of Sciences. 

My research focuses on three areas: 

**Political Methodology**: I specialize in measurement, with a particular emphasis on latent dynamic models that can handle temporal data structures and are capable of integrating data from multiple survey projects. I also have a keen interest in Bayesian statistics. 

**Comparative Political Behavior**:  My research in this area is centered around two themes. First, I focus on political participation, addressing various conceptual and measurement challenges related to this construct. Second, I examine how events such as campaigns against minorities can activate collective identities, leading to expressive political behavior.

**LGBT+ Politics**:  My research interests also encompass LGBT+ politics, particularly the questions of how LGBT-related issues get politicized and what determines public opinion towards LGBT+ individuals.
